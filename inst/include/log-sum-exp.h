*             = log(x) + log1p(-exp(log(y) - log(x))),
*  with log(x) and log(y) given as inputs, i.e. on the log-scale. When x and y
*  are of very different magnitudes, this is more stable when x is taken to be
*  the larger of the inputs. The most extreme case is when one of the inputs
*  might be -inf; in this case that input should be the second one.
